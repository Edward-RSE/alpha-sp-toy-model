# A toy model to experiment with numerical integrators

This toy model has been made to experiment with the numerical integrators in
GSL to compute the spontaneous recombination coefficient for macro atoms in
the MCRT program Python. 

The hope is that we can find a good compromise between accuracy and speed, as 
the current method in use is becoming too expensive.
